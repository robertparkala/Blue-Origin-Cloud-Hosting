# Blue-Origin-Cloud-Hosting

Responsive Web Design Projects - Building a Cloud Hosting website. Use HTML and CSS to complete this project.

The goal is to create a fully responsive website for a cloud hosting service, modelled after Heroku.com. Since this project is also a part of the 100daysofcode challenge all of the additional notes for it will reside in the 100 days of code repository which I have forked. File to look for > log.md.
